<p>Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution

<h2 id="using-the-issue-tracker">Using the issue tracker</h2>
<p>When <a href="#reporting-bugs-with-select2">reporting bugs</a> or
<a href="#requesting-features-in-select2">requesting features</a>, the
<a href="https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2/issues">issue tracker on GitHub</a> is the recommended channel to use.</p>
<p>The issue tracker <strong>is not</strong> a place for support requests. The
<a href="https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2#mailing-list">mailing list</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2#irc-channel">IRC channel</a> are better places to
get help.</p>
<h2 id="reporting-bugs-with-select2">Reporting bugs with Select2</h2>
<p>We really appreciate clear bug reports that <em>consistently</em> show an issue
<em>within Select2</em>.</p>
<p>The ideal bug report follows these guidelines:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use the <a href="https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2/search?q=&amp;type=Issues">GitHub issue search</a></strong>  &mdash; Check if the issue
has already been reported.</li>
<li><strong>Check if the issue has been fixed</strong>  &mdash; Try to reproduce the problem
using the code in the <code>master</code> branch.</li>
<li><strong>Isolate the problem</strong>  &mdash; Try to create an
<a href="http://css-tricks.com/6263-reduced-test-cases/">isolated test case</a> that consistently reproduces the problem.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please try to be as detailed as possible in your bug report, especially if an
isolated test case cannot be made. Some useful questions to include the answer
to are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What steps can be used to reproduce the issue?</li>
<li>What is the bug and what is the expected outcome?</li>
<li>What browser(s) and Operating System have you tested with?</li>
<li>Does the bug happen consistently across all tested browsers?</li>
<li>What version of jQuery are you using? And what version of Select2?</li>
<li>Are you using Select2 with other plugins?</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these questions will help people fix and identify any potential bugs.</p>
<h2 id="requesting-features-in-select2">Requesting features in Select2</h2>
<p>Select2 is a large library that carries with it a lot of functionality. Because
of this, many feature requests will not be implemented in the core library.</p>
<p>Before starting work on a major feature for Select2, <strong>contact the
<a href="https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2#community">community</a> first</strong> or you may risk spending a considerable amount of
time on something which the project developers are not interested in bringing
into the project.</p>
<h3 id="select2-4-0">Select2 4.0</h3>
<p>Many feature requests will be closed off until 4.0, where Select2 plans to adopt
a more flexible API.  If you are interested in helping with the development of
the next major Select2 release, please send a message to the
<a href="https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2#mailing-list">mailing list</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2#irc-channel">irc channel</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="triaging-issues-and-pull-requests">Triaging issues and pull requests</h2>
<p>Anyone can help the project maintainers triage issues and review pull requests.</p>
<h3 id="handling-new-issues">Handling new issues</h3>
<p>Select2 regularly receives new issues which need to be tested and organized.</p>
<p>When a new issue that comes in that is similar to another existing issue, it
should be checked to make sure it is not a duplicate.  Duplicates issues should
be marked by replying to the issue with &quot;Duplicate of #[issue number]&quot; where
<code>[issue number]</code> is the url or issue number for the existing issue.  This will
allow the project maintainers to quickly close off additional issues and keep
the discussion focused within a single issue.</p>
<p>If you can test issues that are reported to Select2 that contain test cases and
confirm under what conditions bugs happen, that will allow others to identify
what causes a bug quicker.</p>
<h3 id="reviewing-pull-requests">Reviewing pull requests</h3>
<p>It is very common for pull requests to be opened for issues that contain a clear
solution to the problem.  These pull requests should be rigorously reviewed by
the community before being accepted.  If you are not sure about a piece of
submitted code, or know of a better way to do something, do not hesitate to make
a comment on the pull request.</p>
<p>It should also be made clear that <strong>all code contributed to Select</strong> must be
licensable under the <a href="https://github.com/ivaynberg/select2#copyright-and-license">Apache 2 or GPL 2 licenses</a>.  Code that cannot
be released under either of these licenses <strong>cannot be accepted</strong> into the
project.</p>
